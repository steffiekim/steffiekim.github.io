					<h3 class ="blue"><b>The Problem</b></h3>
					While research confirms that other people's movements deliver social cues in interpersonal communication, it has not yet been investigated as to how varying degrees of interpersonal distance and approach speed can affect social anxiety and personal bubbles, especially in virtual environments.
					
					<br><br>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Research Questions</b></h3>
					<br>
					<section class="component">
						<blockquote class="sidekick">
							How does virtual agents' interpersonal distance and approach speed influence the level of state social anxiety, personal space, and sense of physical closeness? 				
					  	</blockquote>
						<blockquote class="sidekick">
							Are the effects different between socially anxious individuals and healthy individuals?
					  	</blockquote>
					</section>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>The Goal</b></h3>
					<li>Investigate how to optimize interpersonal distance and approach speed of virtual agents in virtual environments.</li>
					<li>Investigate how virtual agents should be designed differently according to the level of social anxiety.</li>
					<br>
					
					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Research Design</b></h3>
					<li>305 participants (147 socially anxious individuals and 158 healthy individuals) were recruited on Prolific.</li>
					<li>2 conditions for interpersonal distance (close vs. far) and 2 conditions for approach speed (slow vs. fast) were tested in an online experiment.</li>
						<center>
							<img src="images/project_VR-movement/experiment.png" alt="Experimental conditions">

					<br><br>
					<li>Virtual agents and movements were created using Unity and Adobe Mixamo.</li>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Analysis</b></h3>
					<li>After data cleaning, 189 observations (127 socially anxious individuals and 62 healthy individuals) were included in the analysis.</li>
					<li>To account for the violation of normal distribution,robust independent-samples <i>t</i>-tests and robust two-way ANOVAs were performed in R.</li>

					<br>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Key Findings</b></h3>
					<b><i>Socially anxious individuals vs. Healthy individuals:</i></b><br>
					<li>Without considering the experimental conditions, socially anxious individuals experienced greater level of state social anxiety and personal space invasion than healthy individuals.</li>
					<li>Interestingly, the two groups did not differ in terms of estimating objective distance, while socially anxious individuals reported higher levels of subjective perception of interpersonal distance from the virtual agents.</li>
					<br>

					<b><i>State social anxiety:</i></b><br>
					<li>Both socially anxious individuals and healthy individuals were not affected by the different conditions of interpersonal distance or approach speed.</li>
					<li>It could possibly be that the level of state social anxiety stays at the same level regardless of the different conditions within each group (socially anxious individuals vs. healthy individuals).</li>
					<br>

					<b><i>Personal space invasion:</i></b><br>
					<li>Socially anxious individuals felt that their personal space was invaded when the virtual agents were in the closer interpersonal distance condition.</li>
					<li>iSAD is sensitive to the different conditions of physical proximity (close vs. far) within the already social-anxiety-provoking interpersonal distances. </li>
					<li>In contrast, healthy individuals did not show any difference in the perceived personal space invasion in both close and far distance conditions.</li>
					<li>The distance between virtual others and the participants in the current experiment may have been acceptable for healthy individuals, but not for iSAD.</li>
					<br>

					<b><i>Subjective sense of physical closeness:</i></b><br>
					<li>Socially anxious individuals felt that their personal space was invaded when the virtual agents were in the closer interpersonal distance condition.</li>
					<li>In contrast, healthy individuals did not show any difference in the subjective sense of physical closeness in both close and far distance conditions.</li>
					<li>iSAD, where they reported greater perceived proximity in the slow approach speed condition than in the fast approach speed condition. approach speed did not have a significant effect on perceived proximity for healthy individuals. </li>
					<li>slowly approaching virtual humans might be perceived as less trustworthy than those approaching with a faster speed. slowly approaching strangers may trigger a fight-or-flight response for iSAD.</li>
					<br>

					<b><i>Objective estimation of distance:</i></b><br>
					<li>for healthy individuals, physical proximity had a significant main effect on the estimation of distance, whereas it had no impact on iSAD</li>
					<li>However, the results may imply that, when the focus is on iSAD, the ability to objectively perceive the virtual others' physical proximity may not have any variance due to SAD, </li>
					<br>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Recommendations</b></h3>
					<li>practitioners and researchers can design VR interventions that gradually expose iSAD to closer distances, starting from farther distances, such that they feel less intimidated. This way, iSAD may eventually adjust to feeling comfortable with the same distances that are considered acceptable by healthy individuals. </li>

					<li>Practitioners and researchers should program VR interventions such that iSAD can be trained to get comfortable with fast-moving virtual others first and then gradually with slowly moving virtual others to reduce their SAD symptoms.</li>

					<br>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Impact</b></h3>
					<li>is pioneering in the examination of virtual others' movements and investigation of SAD while considering the potential use of this relationship in VE for developing efficacious VR interventions for iSAD</li>
					<li>Implications for safety policy</li>
					<li></li>

					<br>

					<h3 class ="blue"><b>Unanswered Questions</b></h3>
					<li>The findings should be confirmed in immersive VR headsets for better application.</li>
					<li>More proportionate participants supported by additional funding will increase the power of analysis.</li>
